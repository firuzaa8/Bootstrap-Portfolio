                <p>Hello to anyone who would bother to read this bio! Only a few weeks ago I was tanning under the beautiful sun in one of the most luxurious resorts of Russia; 
                        today I am attempting to advance in programming. It is a quite unexpected turn of events for me as naturally I am an absolutely anti-technology person.
                       I am a strong believer that all of the current advancements in technology have led people to loneliness. 
                       Therefore, I am here today in order to get to know the enemy a bit closer. I am living a very busy and fulfilled life of a wife and mother of three kids.
                       The last two kids came as a set of twins; you know what hardship is when you have two newborns screaming at your face; those were the moments when I questioned
                       my every decision, my sanity, and the posibility that Elon Musk might be right - life is just a simulation, and someone just decided to punish my character.
                       I meditate and stay outside for at least an hour every day for my sanity: rain or shine. I love high-end whiskey. I believe in karma. I speak three 
                       languages. I was born in a country that doesn't exist anymore, and escaped to Russia as a refugee when I was little, then escaped Russia to become an American when I was 21.
                       Very few things scare me. For instance: not knowing how many people all at once can lose their ethics and hurt others. My ancestors went through genocide, and 
                       that scary question has been in my thoughts an endless number of times since I was little. It is an absolutely mortifying idea to ponder.
                       Last fact: I am an absolute believer in the concepts of equality and equity. There has to be a balance in everything. Things outside of balance are wobbly.</p>
